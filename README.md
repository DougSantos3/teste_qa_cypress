This is a Test QA - project using  [`cypress`](https://www.cypress.io/).

## Getting Started

You need to download the packages:

```bash
node: v22.11.0
```

npm install
# or
yarn
```

Run tests:

```bash
# Open dashboard cypress
npm run cy:open

# Run tests ui
npm run test:ui

# Run tests api
npm run test:api
```

## Learn More

From the test application I have my postman collection with more automated scripts than the one that comes in the serverRest repository. Mine is more up to date:

colletion_postman/myCollection.postman_collection.json
<br>
colletion_postman/postman_environment.json
